<!-- REFLECTION: 

1. A challenge I faced during this lesson was deciding how to structure all of the JS based on the directions. I decided to go with two variables for checking validity instead of one. I ended up just starting and getting some code on the screen and from there it worked itself out. I also struggled with a bug for a while. My output message was showing success even though I would enter an incorrect email through the site. After troubleshooting the code it ended up being something small. I just had to change the name of the extra variable I added.  -->
